"""Adapter registry — resolves (mcp_server_id, tool_name) -> AdapterFn.

Resolution order:

  1. Specialized adapter explicitly registered in ``_SPECIALIZED``
     (e.g. ``ida_headless.decompile`` -> ``adapt_decompile``).
  2. Generic adapter ``adapt_generic`` when the tool name is in
     ``KNOWN_TOOLS[server_id]`` but no specialized adapter exists.
  3. ``None`` when the tool name is unknown — tool_executor surfaces a
     loud error message back to the engine so it can retry with a
     correct name.

This means the engine can invoke any of the 135 MCP tools immediately;
tools with high-value structured rendering get specialized adapters as
they become useful in real investigations.
